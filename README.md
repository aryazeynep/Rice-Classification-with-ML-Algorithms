# Description
In this project, my classmate and I implemented and compared several machine learning classification algorithms using the Scikit-learn library to deepen our understanding of core ML concepts.

We worked with a dataset of 75,000 rice samples and applied four classification methods:

- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

- Naive Bayes

- Random Forest

- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

The project is divided into two main parts:

- Classification based on the given textual features extracted from rice images

- Classification based directly on the image data itself

We randomly split the data into 80% training and 20% testing sets, and applied K-Fold Cross Validation for more reliable evaluation. Throughout the project, we analyzed model performance using various classification metrics.
